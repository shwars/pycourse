Welcome to an Introduction to Python with Turtle Graphics and Fractals! In this course, we will introduce you to main concepts of **Computer Programming** using one of the most popular programming languages today - **Python**. You will also learn to make computer  draw nice pictures - like the one below:

**Computer programming** is a way to tell computer to do things. For example, you can ask computer to calculate the product of all number from 1 to 10. To do that, you need to express your instructions in a clear way, and in a language understandable by a computer. We will learn the language called **Python**, but there are also other popular languages, such as C#, C++ or Javascript.

In this course we will use a technology called **Jupyter Notebooks**. Notebooks are documents that combine normal text with some computer code that you can **execute**. While you can read notebooks here by following the links, to execute them you need some programming environment. There are several ways you can execute notebooks and follow this course:

* **Install Python and Jupyter on your computer**. It is a good idea to do so if you are serious about learning programming. I typically recommend to start with [miniconda](https://conda.io/en/latest/miniconda.html), but you can also install [Anaconda](https://anaconda.org/), or [official Python distribution](https://www.python.org/downloads/) 
* Use [GitHub Codespaces](https://github.com/features/codespaces). Currently you need to apply for early access to this technology, which may take time. 
* Use **Binder** by clicking on the button at the top of this page.
